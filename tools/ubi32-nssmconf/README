This is a modified version of standard Linux kconfig tool to enable NSS software configuration.
These modifications might render the tool unusable with standard Linux.

Follow these steps to compile the needed binaries:

	1) Do a 'make'. This will populate the bin directory with three binaries
	    - nss_mconf, nss_conf and nss_lxdialog.
	2) Add the bin directory to your path or copy all three binaries into a
	    directory that is in your path.
	3) Now cd to the NSS source directory and execute 'make menuconfig'.
	4) This should bring up the GUI interface which you can use to configure the NSS software.
